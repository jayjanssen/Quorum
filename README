Quorum v1

Quorum is a REST webservice written in node.js that sits on top of a zookeeper cluster.  The REST interface implements a leasing service, which allows clients to do normal leasing actions like acquire, renew, release, get.  

More information to come on the API documentation and usage patterns.

Currently there is no integration with any systems like npm, etc. to handle install and dependencies for you.  

Dependencies:
 - Node.js (obviously)
 - Zookeeper server running on localhost:2181, and zookeeper client (3.3.3)
 - node-zookeeper (https://github.com/yfinkelstein/node-zookeeper)
